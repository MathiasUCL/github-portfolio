I spent today properly setting up my portfolio and the blog for this project. So that I'm able to create
posts like this one easier.

The last few days have been spent working on Unity and trying out tutorials for Unity to learn how to
set up a project and give a better idea of what our feature list should look like and include at the
start of the project.

We have also been brainstorming ideas for the game, what it's gonna look like, which features to add,
etc.

The next while will be spent continuing Unity tutorials, and writting down a lot of ideas for the game
and turning these ideas into a feature list, that feels realistic for the project.
