title: "Devlog #5 – Status effects"

The goal since last Devlog has been to create a player attack, that is able to hit and kill enemies and
apply status effects.

This started out with creating a basic swing attack for the player, to allow the player to do damage to
the enemy and by doing so allowing the player to kill the enemy. After this was done I started working
on creating a system for status effects, that is flexible in creating new status effects and having them
cause different effects based on conditions, like reaching a certain amount of stacks. 


Since the last devlog, I've made a lot of progress in both learning and creating a good foundation for the
game. The week has been very productive and a great start to actually setting up a basic game. Although it 
was pretty difficult setting up a coherrent and flexible system for status effects, that also allows building
upon it and creating more possibilities for future effects.
