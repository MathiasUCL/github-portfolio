title: "Devlog #3 – Unity tutorials"
date: 2025-08-29
---
The goal for this week was to gain the knowledge of Unity, to be able to create a good foundation for 
the games setup in Unity, to allow for more flexible and effecient implementation of features.

That's why I spent this week going through different Unity tutorials, to better my understanding of the
program and learn how to use the different features of the program. While also noting down any ideas
that sprung to mind for the games.

The work this week went well, as it helped me gain an understanding for how working with unity will be,
while also gaining some of the knowledge that is required to make proper use of Unity. Other than that
this week was a lot about individuel work, partly because we were a member down because of a vacation.
But also because we didn't have a good understanding of Unity and therefore needed to gather some knowledge,
before we would be able to make proper decisions for what to do next in the project.
