The goal for this week is to start creating a foundation for the game, to create the most basic start
for the game. This includes creating a playable character, create an enemy and create a map.

I spent majority of the week so far setting up an enemy, making it chase the player around and be able
to do damage to the player and take damage from the player. I also worked on setting up animations for
the enemy, by using free assets.

The work has been going great this week so far, as I've had a great start to creating a functional base
game. I've learnt a lot about using Unity and how different individuel parts of the game comes together
to form a game. I'll be finishing up some touches on the basic enemy and move more into creating some
slightly more advanced features, in making the player able to hit and have weapons apply effects.
